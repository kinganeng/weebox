Weebox is a pop window plugin based on jquery. At the very begining, I tried the modaldialog in my project, but the tool's functions are too limited. So I started to change the code, and eventually the code has been rewrited completely, only the css and background pictures are left, so I picked a new name for it: Weebox.
